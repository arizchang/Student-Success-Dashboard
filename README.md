The purpose of this project is to create a tool that will help students to be more organized and help them be more accademically successful. Think of this tool as something similar to Canvas or MyASU but displaying a holistic overview of what is going on in each of their classes.  
The original scope of the project was only targeted towards students, but we later saw a use case for advisors as well, so we expanded the scope of the project to include them. We figured that these two parties can work side-by-side to achieve the student's goals, so it made sense ot consider both customer types.
